				<p class="info">When he was crowned King of a Maratha Kingdom which later developed into the Maratha
					Empire eventually covering majority of modern day India. A climb of about 1450 steps the Raigad Fort
					is situated a top hill. today a rope-way exists to reach the top of the fort. This fort has
					supported its rulers during battles and war periods, as it contains many hiding places surrounding
					the fort thereby helping them to attack the enemies eminently. Even during the ruling of British
					Empire across India, the Raigad district was found to be difficult for the Englishmen to bring under
					control as the Raigad Fort was in the hands of local king who restricted them from entering the
					area.<br> At l ast, the British troops were left with no option other than destroying the fort by
					cannons in 1765.</p>

					The lake is situated in the front of "Bale Killa". Balekilla means the central part of the fort and
